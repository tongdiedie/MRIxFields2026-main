## About

MRI systems operate at different magnetic field strengths (0.1T to 7T), each with distinct trade-offs between image quality, cost, and accessibility. Ultra-high-field (7T) MRI provides exceptional anatomical detail but remains limited to specialized centers. Ultra-low-field (0.1T) systems are portable and cost-effective but suffer from reduced signal-to-noise ratio. Meanwhile, the majority of clinical MRI studies use heterogeneous mid-range field strengths (1.5T-3T), creating systematic variability that challenges cross-center data integration.

**MRIxFields2026** provides a rigorous benchmark for assessing robustness, generalizability, and anatomical fidelity of generative models in multi-field MRI translation.

## Participant Guide

> **Getting started?** Follow these 6 steps from data download to final submission.

| Step | What to Do | Where to Look |
|:----:|------------|---------------|
| 1 | **Understand the Tasks** — Learn what each task requires | [Below](#1-understand-the-tasks) |
| 2 | **Get the Data** — Download and explore the dataset | [Below](#2-get-the-data) |
| 3 | **Set Up Environment** — Install dependencies and configure paths | [Below](#3-set-up-environment) |
| 4 | **Develop Your Model** — Use our baselines or build your own | [Baseline/](Baseline/) |
| 5 | **Evaluate Your Results** — Run local evaluation | [Evaluation/](Evaluation/) |
| 6 | **Submit** — Upload your predictions | [Submission/](Submission/) |

### 1. Understand the Tasks

| Task | Goal | Input | Output |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| **Task 1** | Ultra-high field synthesis | 0.1T, 1.5T, 3T, or 5T | 7T |
| **Task 2** | Low-field enhancement | 0.1T | 1.5T, 3T, 5T, or 7T |
| **Task 3** | Unified any-to-any translation | Any field | Any field (single model) |

**Task 1: Ultra-High Field MRI Synthesis from Arbitrary Magnetic Field Strengths**

Generate 7T-equivalent brain MRI from arbitrary input field strengths. Models should recover fine anatomical details and quantitative properties associated with 7T imaging.

**Task 2: Higher-Field MRI Generation from Ultra-Low Magnetic Field Strengths**

Enhance 0.1T ultra-low-field MRI to restore clinically meaningful tissue contrast and structural information under severely degraded imaging conditions.

**Task 3: Controllable Field-to-Field MRI Synthesis with a Unified Conditional Model**

Perform any-to-any field translation using a single unified model with explicit conditioning on both source and target field strengths.

> **Model Requirements**:
> - **Task 1 & 2**: You may design separate models for different input field strengths and modalities (up to 12 models: 4 field strengths × 3 modalities).
> - **Task 3**: You must use a **single unified model** with one set of pretrained parameters. Submitting multiple models will result in disqualification.

Teams may participate in any or all tasks independently.

**Additional Constraints for Task3**

Task 3 requires a single jointly trained, parameter-sharing conditional model that supports all source-to-target field transformations within one unified architecture.
Methods that decompose Task 3 into field-specific, target-specific, or source-target-pair-specific dedicated subnetworks/models selected by a router are NOT allowed, even if they are packaged as a single checkpoint.
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style modules are allowed only when they are part of a single end-to-end model with substantial sharing and are not dedicated exclusively to fixed field strengths, contrasts, or translation pairs.
The submission must NOT be functionally equivalent to an ensemble of specialized models for fixed field or translation pairs.

The organizers reserve the right to request additional method details and to make the final determination on whether a submission is consistent with the spirit and requirements of Task 3.

Filename convention: `{R|P}_{modality}_{field}_{subjID}.nii.gz`
- `R` = retrospective (unpaired; subject IDs do **not** overlap across fields)
- `P` = prospective (paired; the **same** subject ID appears at every field strength)
- `modality`: `T1W`, `T2W`, `T2FLAIR`
- `field`: `0.1T`, `1.5T`, `3T`, `5T`, `7T`
- `subjID`: zero-padded 4-digit ID (e.g. `0006`)

See [Tutorial/](Tutorial/) for data exploration notebooks.

# From repo root
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate mf
```

This installs PyTorch (CUDA 12.1), TensorFlow 2.15, and the `mrixfields` package.

For CUDA 11.8: edit `environment.yml` and replace `cu121` with `cu118` before running.

#### Configure Paths

```bash
cp .env.example .env
vim .env  # Edit paths below
```

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATA_DIR` | Dataset root (contains Training_retrospective, etc.) |
| `PREPROCESSED_DIR` | Extracted 2D slices for training |
| `OUTPUT_DIR` | Training checkpoints |
| `INFERENCE_DIR` | Inference outputs |
| `SYNTHSEG_DIR` | SynthSeg installation (for evaluation) |
| `DEVICE` | GPU device (e.g. `cuda:0`) |

#### SynthSeg (for Dice/Volume metrics — Task 1 / Task 2 only)

Skip this section if you are only participating in Task 3.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BBillot/SynthSeg.git /path/to/SynthSeg
```

Download model files — see [Evaluation/README.md](Evaluation/README.md) for details.

### 4. Develop Your Model

You can start with our baseline models (CUT, CycleGAN, StarGAN v2) or develop your own approach.

See [Baseline/](Baseline/) for:
- Preprocessing, training, and inference scripts
- Pre-trained model weights
- Training configurations for all tasks

See [Tutorial/](Tutorial/) for step-by-step Jupyter notebooks.

---

### 5. Evaluate Your Results

Evaluation metrics are scoped per task. **Task 3 uses voxel-level metrics only — no segmentation submission is required.**

| Metric | Description | Direction | Applies to |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------------|
| **nRMSE** | Normalized Root Mean Square Error | Lower is better | Task 1 / 2 / 3 |
| **SSIM** | Structural Similarity Index | Higher is better | Task 1 / 2 / 3 |
| **LPIPS** | Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity | Lower is better | Task 1 / 2 / 3 |
| **Dice** | Overlap on 14 deep gray matter structures (via SynthSeg) | Higher is better | Task 1 / 2 |
| **Volume** | Normalized volume consistency per structure | Higher is better | Task 1 / 2 |

**Ranking**: Per-metric rank summed across the applicable metrics — **5 metrics for Task 1/2**, **3 metrics for Task 3**. Lowest total wins.

Top-ranked submissions undergo blinded visual inspection by experienced neuroradiologists.

See [Evaluation/](Evaluation/) for local evaluation scripts and SynthSeg setup.
